## Overview

Vector Charts charges based on number of requests using the [Pricing structure defined here](https://vectorcharts.com/pricing/).

Requests are free until they pass a minimum quantity. When API usage passes the free tier:

- Accounts without payment method are frozen until the end of the month
- Accounts with payment method begin counting paid requests

The usage tracker resets once a month (30 days), and users are billed once a month. The day that billing occurs may differ from the first of the month, and can be viewed under `Settings > Next Invoice Date`.

## Viewing your API Usage

To view your API usage, click the Usage tab in the cloud dashboard.

This page shows the date and amount for your next bill, along with a chart of historical API usage. The time window can be adjusted on the graph using the dropdown in the top right.

## Invoices

Whenever you are billed, you will be sent an invoice by email that shows the breakdown of fees. You will not receive an invoice on months when the bill is $0.
